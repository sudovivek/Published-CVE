## Vulnerability Description -

 The Student Study Center Management System V1.0, developed by PHPGurukul, is susceptible to a critical security vulnerability known as Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed by the application. The underlying issue lies in the system's failure to adequately sanitize and validate user-provided input within the "Admin Name" field on the Admin Profile page, thereby allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
